# Getting started

## What you’ll do
- Deploy the NetBox charm.
- Integrate with Redis using the redis-k8s charm.
- Integrate with the PostgreSQL K8s charm.
- Integrate with S3 for storage.
- Expose the NetBox charm with Traefik k8s.
- Create a super user.

Through the process, you'll verify the workload state, and log in to
your NetBox instance.

## Requirements
- Juju 3.x installed.
- Juju controller that can create a model of type Kubernetes.
- Read/write access to a S3 compatible server with a bucket created.
- Configuration compatible with the traefik-k8s charms. In the case of MicroK8s this can be achieved with the `metallb` add-on.

For more information about how to install Juju, see [Get started with Juju](https://juju.is/docs/olm/get-started-with-juju).


## Setting up a tutorial model

To manage resources effectively and to separate this tutorial's workload from
your usual work, we recommend creating a new model using the following command.

```
juju add-model netbox-tutorial
```

## Deploy

Deploy the NetBox charm, with all its mandatory requirements (PostgreSQL, Redis and S3).

```
juju deploy netbox
```

At this point NetBox should be blocked as there is no S3 integration for
storage, Redis or PostgreSQL.

Set the allowed hosts. In this example every host is allowed. For a production environment
only the used hosts should be allowed.
```
juju config netbox django-allowed-hosts='*'
```

### Redis

NetBox requires Redis to work. You can deploy Redis with redis-k8s:
```
juju deploy redis-k8s --channel=latest/edge
```

Integrate redis-k8s with NetBox with:
```
juju integrate redis-k8s netbox
```

### Deploy PostgreSQL

NetBox requires PostgreSQL to work. Deploy and integrate with:
```
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel 14/stable --trust
juju integrate postgresql-k8s netbox
```

### Deploy `s3-integrator`

NetBox requires an S3 integration for the uploaded files. This is because
the NetBox charm is designed to work in a high availability (HA) configuration.
This allows uploaded images to be placed on an S3 compatible server instead of
the local filesystem.

You can configure it with:
```
juju deploy s3-integrator --channel edge
juju config s3-integrator endpoint="<aws_endpoing_url>" bucket=<bucket_name> path=<path_in_bucket> region=<region> s3-uri-style=<path_or_host>
juju wait-for application s3-integrator --query='name=="s3-integrator" && (status=="active" || status=="blocked")'
juju run s3-integrator/leader sync-s3-credentials access-key=<aws_access_key_id> secret-key=<aws_secret_access_key>
juju integrate s3-integrator netbox
```

See the [s3-integrator charmhub page](https://charmhub.io/s3-integrator) for more information.

### Deploy `traefik-k8s` 

You need to enable MetalLb if using MicroK8s. See the [traefik-k8s charmhub page](https://charmhub.io/traefik-k8s) for more information.

With the next example, you can configure Traefik using path mode routing:
```
juju deploy traefik-k8s --channel edge --trust
juju config traefik-k8s external_hostname=<netbox_hostname>
juju config traefik-k8s routing_mode=path
juju integrate traefik-k8s netbox
```

If the host `netbox_hostname` can be resolved to the correct IP (the load balancer IP),
you should be able to browse NetBox in the URL http://netbox_hostname/netbox-tutorial-netbox

You can check the endpoints behind the proxy with the command:
```
juju run traefik-k8s/0 show-proxied-endpoints --format=yaml
```

## Create superuser
To be able to login to NetBox, you can create a super user with the next command:
```
juju run netbox/0 create-superuser username=<admin_username> email=<admin_email>
```

Congratulations, With the username created and the password provided in the response, 
you have now full access to your own NetBox!
