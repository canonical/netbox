# NetBox charm architecture

The NetBox charm initial version has been generated with the 
help of the paas-app-charmer project. The paas-app-charmer project provides many
of the functionalities needed by this charm like:
- PostgreSQL integration
- Django migrations
- Ingress integration
- COS (Prometheus metrics and Loki logs for gunicorn).

For the static assets, gunicorn is used with the help of the [WhiteNoiseMiddleware](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

There is only one container for each unit of NetBox, that runs the following
services managed by Pebble:
- django. Runs gunicorn.
- cron. Cron service that runs management commands for housekeeping and syncdatasource.
- statsd_exporter. To expose gunicorn metrics.

Besides the integrations provided directly by the paas-app-charmer toolchain, the following
integrations are implemented in NetBox:
- SAML integration.
- S3 integration.

Currently Redis is configured using environment variables. This will be updated
to use a Redis integration.

The NetBox charm is designed for a high availability (HA) environment.
The NetBox application can be scaled to more than one unit to provide
HA. See [Configure Scripts and Reports for
HA](../how-to/configure-scripts-reports.md) for the requirements to
use scripts and reports in HA configuration.
