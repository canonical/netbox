# Contributing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working [development setup](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/dev-setup).

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

```shell
tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

```shell
tox run -e format        # update your code according to linting rules
tox run -e lint          # code style
tox run -e unit          # unit tests
tox run -e integration   # integration tests
tox                      # runs 'format', 'lint', and 'unit' environments
```

## Build the charm

Build the charm in this git repository using:

```shell
charmcraft pack
```

## Run the integration tests locally

To be able to run the tests locally, you will first need to install and configure localstack. Run the `localstack-installation.sh` to do it.
