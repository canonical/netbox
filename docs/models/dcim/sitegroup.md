# Site Groups

Like regions, site groups can be used to organize sites. Whereas regions are intended to provide geographic organization, site groups can be used to classify sites by role or function. Also like regions, site groups can be nested to form a hierarchy. Sites which belong to a child group are also considered to be members of any of its parent groups.
